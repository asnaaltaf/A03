         Choose “Create New repository”
Step 8 - Make the Repository pubic and add the readme file.
         Click Create.
         The Repository is now set-up.
Step 9 - WebStorm integrates with many popular version control systems, like Git (or GitHub)
         You have the ability to view changes you or others make and **commit** and **push** your changes if needed.
Step 10 - If you want to check out a project from a version control system, see Check out a project (**clone**) for details.
Step 11 - In the case that you need to resolve a merge conflict on Github
          (a) Under your repository name, pull requests
          (b) In the "Pull Requests" list, click the **pull** request with a **merge conflict** that you'd like to resolve.
          (c) Near the bottom of your pull request, click Resolve conflicts
          (d) If you would like to add a **merge** que, in the "Pull Requests" list, click the pull request you would like to add to a merge queue to
Step 12 - If you would like to add a new **remote**, use the git remote to add a command on the terminal

Additional Info 
- The git **fetch** command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into a local repo.
- In the case that you need to fix bugs, **branches** allow you to develop features to do so.
  Additionally, you can safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository
